Technologies Used & Rationale
•	Python: Chosen for its simplicity and extensive library support.
•	Pandas: Used for reading and processing Excel files efficiently.
•	Requests: Facilitates HTTP communication with Tally.
•	Logging: Helps track errors and debug issues.
Libraries, APIs, and Frameworks Used
•	pandas - For reading bank transaction data from Excel.
•	requests - To send XML-based HTTP requests to Tally.
•	openpyxl - Required for reading .xlsx Excel files.
Why XML-based HTTP and Not ODBC?
•	Direct Integration: Tally supports XML-based communication via its Tally Integration Interface (Tally Gateway Server).
•	Cross-Platform Compatibility: XML-based communication does not require additional drivers like ODBC, which is system-dependent.
•	No Database Access Required: ODBC would be used for direct database querying, but we interact with Tally’s API, which works best with XML.
Challenges Faced & Solutions
1.	Ledger Existence Check
o	Challenge: Ensuring transactions are only posted if the corresponding ledger exists.
o	Solution: Implemented a function to check ledger existence before posting transactions.
2.	Missing Ledgers
o	Challenge: Transactions failing due to missing ledgers.
o	Solution: Developed a function to create a ledger if it doesn’t exist before posting the transaction.
3.	Transaction Posting Errors
o	Challenge: Handling cases where transactions were not posted correctly.
o	Solution: Implemented logging to capture errors and retry mechanisms where needed.
